# Playbook Files — Definition & Construction Guide

## Purpose
Playbooks capture **judgement-based guidance** for situations where strict contracts are insufficient and contextual decision-making is required.

They guide *how to think*, not *what must be done*.

## Exists to help the reader:
- Make consistent decisions in ambiguous situations
- Understand trade-offs and consequences
- Choose between multiple valid approaches
- Avoid common pitfalls when context matters

## A Playbook answers:
- “How should I decide here?”
- “What usually works and why?”
- “What trade-offs matter?”
- “What can go wrong if I choose poorly?”

## A Playbook is NOT:
- NOT enforceable law (contract)
- NOT a step-by-step procedure (how-to)
- NOT a completion checklist
- NOT a dumping ground for rules

## What a good Playbook achieves:
- Reduces inconsistent decision-making
- Makes implicit experience explicit
- Surfaces trade-offs clearly
- Prevents misuse of otherwise-valid patterns
- Aligns decisions with DevKit intent
