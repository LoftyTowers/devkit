## XML Comments Guidelines
Use XML comments only where they add real value:
- Public API boundaries (controllers, DTOs, public interfaces)
- Non-obvious behaviour or invariants
- Omit for short private methods and clear domain types
- Keep summaries short and imperative (e.g. "Processes payment requests.")
