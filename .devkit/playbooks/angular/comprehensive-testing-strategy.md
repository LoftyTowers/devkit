# Comprehensive Testing Strategy Playbook

## Scope
This playbook covers comprehensive Angular testing strategy guidance with emphasis on end-to-end coverage and page object usage. It focuses on balancing E2E coverage with broader testing approaches.

## Core guidance

- E2E tests SHOULD cover critical end-user workflows.
- E2E tests SHOULD use page objects to encapsulate page interactions.

## Anti-patterns
- Test strategies SHOULD NOT over-rely on end-to-end tests.
- E2E tests SHOULD NOT rely on direct DOM manipulation instead of page objects.

## Allowed deviations
